gcloud auth list
gcloud config list
gcloud config list project
gcloud config set project <PROJECT_ID>
gcloud config set compute/region us-central1
gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-f

Note: When you run gcloud on your own machine, the config settings would've been persisted across sessions. 
But in Cloud Shell, you will need to set this for every new session or reconnection.
dev_appserver.py ./ // run the python application
gcloud app deploy app.yaml // deploy in app engine
